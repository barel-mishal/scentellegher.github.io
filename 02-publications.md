>#### __Personality Traits and Ego-network Dynamics.__
>*Centellegher, S., López, E., Saramäki, J., Lepri, B.*\\
We interact with a wide network of people on a daily basis, and these social relationships play an important functional role in our lives. However, there are costs to their maintenance, resulting in a trade-off between quality and quantity, a typical strategy being to put a lot of effort on a few high-intensity relationships while maintaining larger numbers of less close relationships.  Here, we focus on how personality traits of individuals affect this picture, using mobile phone calls records and survey data from the Mobile Territorial Lab (MTL) study. On broader terms, our study shows that personality traits clearly affect the ways in which individuals maintain their personal networks.\\

### 2016

>#### __The Mobile Territorial Lab: a multilayered and dynamic view on parents’ daily lives.__
>*Centellegher, S., De Nadai, M., Caraviello, M., Leonardi, C., Vescovi, M., ... & Lepri, B.*\\
>The exploration of people’s everyday life has long been of interest to social scientists. Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in analyzing human behavioral data generated by technology (e.g. mobile phones).
In this paper, we describe the Mobile Territorial Lab (MTL) project, a longitudinal living lab which has been sensing by means of technology (mobile phones) the lives of more than 100 parents in different areas of the Trentino region in Northern Italy. We present the preliminary results of the most complete picture of parents’ daily lives that include their social interactions, mobility routines, spending patterns, and personality characteristics.\\

>#### __ETSCH: Partition-centric Graph Processing.__
>*Guerrieri, A., Montresor, A., Centellegher, S.*\\
>The "big data" phenomenon has created the need to manage and analyze larger and larger datasets. A distributed system is able to cope with potentially unlimited datasets, is more robust to hardware failures, is often cheaper and it is also much easier to use than it was a decade ago.
This paper presents ETSCH, a novel paradigm for processing large graphs. ETSCH departs from the vertex-based approach of BSP frameworks like PREGEL in two ways: first, the units of computation are not the vertices, but rather a collection of subgraphs; second, the subgraphs are obtained through an edge-partitioning algorithm and computations over the graph are then expressed using classical centralized algorithms executed on each of the partitions, with the only additional burden of specifying simple reconciliation procedures when vertices are replicated in multiple computing nodes.\\
